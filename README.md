# Piano Visualization

## Overview
Here you can upload your .musicxml or .xml file and see the coloring measures in case of their difficulty.

If you will upload .mxl file you will not see this analysis. In this case you can convert it with help of [niversoft](https://www.niversoft.com/products/xml2nwc/).
Some testing .musicxml files you can see [here](https://www.musicxml.com/music-in-musicxml/example-set/).

In analysis I'm using graces, trills, tuplets, chords and tempo.
